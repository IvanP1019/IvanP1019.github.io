## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* # Lab 4

  *  Was one of my favorite labs because our task was to code a guessing game which in the end involved 2 players to play. In that lab it taught you how to do simple coding logic so it was improving my coding experience. I was also proud that I made a game just by coding.

* # Lab 7 Part 1

  *   It was one of my favorite codes we got to create a game called Blackjack along with practicing how to improve coding skills as well. I played that game with my family many times so I really enjoy playing it but it was amazing creating the game.

* # Lab 12

  *   It was another one of my favorites. We got to work with RGB and animation and it created the image of what you wanted. It was a hard lab to figure out but the outcome for the lab was worth it. It was a code that taught you a lot about the animation and those images of different inputs.
